After looking at priorit recommendations, I agree we should fix 1-7.

Generate a markdown file with the plan to fix these issues. Create high level tasks for each fix. Next, generate a list of subtasks for each high level task.

Be sure to update any tests that are affected by these changes.

Finally, make sure errors that could be returned to the frontend are uniform.

After this pull request is merged, we will do an analysis on the frontend error handling.
