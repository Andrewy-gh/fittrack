Before I implement this new endpoint, I have a few questions to ensure I follow the project's conventions
  and best practices correctly:

   1. Endpoint Path & HTTP Method:
      - The proposed query retrieves distinct workout focus values for a user. This is a collection endpoint.
        According to our conventions, it should return a 200 OK with [] when empty, never a 404.
      - What path should we use for this endpoint? Some options:
        - GET /workouts/focus-values (under workouts resource)
        - GET /workout-focus-values (new top-level resource)
        - Another path you prefer?

    **ANSWER**

    I think based on the conventions of our codebase, it should return a 200 OK. I want to go with this endpoint path: GET /workout-focus-values

   2. Response Format:
      - The query returns a list of distinct string values. Should the response be a simple JSON array of
        strings like:

   1      ["Chest", "Back", "Legs"]
      - Or should it be wrapped in an object for extensibility, e.g.:

   1      {
   2        "workoutFocusValues": ["Chest", "Back", "Legs"]
   3      }
      - Our current collection endpoints (e.g., ListWorkouts) return arrays directly. I'll follow that pattern
         unless you specify otherwise.

    I want to go with this response format: ["Chest", "Back", "Legs"]

    **ANSWER**
    Yes, Let's maintain the current co-based conventions and return in a very directly.

   3. SQL Query Location:
      - I need to add the SQL query to a .sql file that sqlc will process. Based on the file structure, I
        assume it should go in a file like server/internal/database/query.sql. However, I couldn't find this
        file.
      - Is there a specific file where I should add the new query? If query.sql doesn't exist, should I create
         it?
    
    **ANSWER**
    The query should go in `query.sql` which is located in root directory. If you are currently located in the server directory, you should go up one level, but it seems like you are already in root.

   4. Indexing:
      - The proposal mentions creating an index for (workout_focus, user_id). I should add this to our
        database schema migration files. Is there a standard place for these migrations (e.g.,
        server/internal/database/migrations/)?
    
    **ANSWER**
    I already created an index and it is located in `00011_add_index_to_workout_focus_col.sql` which is located the `/server/migrations` directory.
    

   5. Swagger Documentation:
      - I'll add the necessary Swagger annotations to the handler function. The description will include that
        it returns 200 OK with an empty array [] if there are no workout focus values for the user.
    
    **ANSWER**
    Yes, I will add the necessary Swagger annotations to the handler function. Return 200 OK with an empty array [] if there are no workout focus values for the user.

  Please let me know your preferences for these points, especially 1, 2, and 3, before I proceed with the
  implementation.
