  The plan covers the main steps needed but is missing some important details.
  Here's what I think is missing:

   1. API Response Structure Update: The plan mentions updating the structs but
      doesn't specify updating the response models that would include the new
      workout_focus field in API responses.

**ANSWER**

Yes, if you mean the swagger types we will have to update them in `/workout/models.go`. I will have to update the swagger types with "make swagger"


   2. Validation Rules: The plan doesn't mention adding validation for the new
      field in the request structs.

**ANSWER** 

I believe we will have to update `CreateWorkoutRequest`. It is not a required column.

   3. Test Updates: While the plan mentions updating tests, it doesn't specify what
      kinds of tests need to be updated.

**ANSWER**

Check the tests after the changes, if they fail then handle them please

   4. Swagger Documentation: The plan doesn't mention updating the Swagger
      documentation for the API endpoints.

**ANSWER**

Good catch, we definitely need to run "make swagger"

   5. Migration File Naming: The plan doesn't specify the naming convention for the
      new migration file.

**ANSWER"

The file name will be `00010_add_workout_focus_col_to_workout_table.sql`

  Questions Before Implementation

   1. Field Purpose: What is the intended purpose of the workout_focus field? Is it
      meant to categorize workouts (e.g., "strength", "endurance", "hypertrophy") or
       is it free-form text?

**ANSWER**

You are on track. It's basically to categorize workouts so they can be:
- Push
- Pull
- Arms
- Upper body
- Lower body
These are just examples, but I'm sure you get the idea.

   2. Validation Requirements: Should the workout_focus field have any specific
      validation rules (e.g., enum values, max length beyond the 256 already
      specified)?

**ANSWER** 
It is a not required column, so I guess we should check for max length and that it is also a string

   3. Default Value: Should the new column have a default value, or should it
      remain nullable as specified?

**ANSWER**
No default value is necessary. However, if the user does not input one, it can remain as null.

   4. Backward Compatibility: How should existing workouts without a focus be
      handled? Should they display a default value in the UI?

**ANSWER**
The migration won't break. However we can add null to existing rows to make sure app does not break. I will create a script later to fill the exisiting workout rows with a workout_focus" value that is the same to that workout's notes. Don't worry about the front-end, I will handle it. This is a back-end focus PR.

   5. Indexing: Should we add an index on the workout_focus column for query
      performance if we plan to filter by this field?

**ANSWER**

I trust that you can decide if we need optimazation

  Let me know if you'd like me to proceed with the implementation based on the
  current plan, or if you'd like to address these questions first.
