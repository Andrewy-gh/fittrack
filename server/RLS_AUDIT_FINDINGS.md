# RLS Policy Coverage & Privilege Escalation Audit Report

**Date:** January 2025  
**Task:** Step 5 - Audit policy coverage & privilege escalation  
**Database:** PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS)  

## Executive Summary

⚠️ **CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES FOUND** ⚠️

The RLS audit has revealed **multiple critical security vulnerabilities** that allow users to bypass Row Level Security and access other users' data. These issues must be addressed immediately before production deployment.

## Findings Summary

### ✅ Policy Coverage Analysis
- **Total Tables:** 5 user tables identified
- **Tables with RLS Enabled:** 4/5 (80%)
- **Tables with Policies:** 3/5 (60%)
- **Tables without RLS:** 1 (goose_db_version - low risk)

### ❌ Critical Security Gaps Identified

#### 1. **CRITICAL: Missing RLS Policies on `set` Table**
- **Risk Level:** HIGH
- **Issue:** Table has RLS enabled but NO policies defined
- **Impact:** Should block ALL access but currently allows unrestricted access
- **Test Result:** 83 rows visible (should be 0)
- **Status:** VULNERABLE

#### 2. **CRITICAL: RLS Bypass in Core Tables**
- **Risk Level:** CRITICAL
- **Issue:** Users can see ALL users' data instead of just their own
- **Impact:** Complete data isolation failure
- **Test Results:**
  - `users` table: User sees 5 users instead of 1 (FAIL)
  - `workout` table: Each user sees 26 workouts instead of 2 (FAIL) 
  - `exercise` table: User sees 24 exercises instead of expected subset (FAIL)

#### 3. **CRITICAL: SQL Injection Bypass**
- **Risk Level:** CRITICAL  
- **Issue:** `OR 1=1` injection patterns bypass RLS
- **Test Result:** Returns 5 rows instead of 1 (FAIL)
- **Impact:** Malicious queries can access unauthorized data

## Detailed Technical Findings

### Tables Missing RLS Protection

| Table | RLS Status | Policies | Risk Level | Action Required |
|-------|------------|----------|------------|-----------------|
| `goose_db_version` | DISABLED | None | LOW | Consider if RLS needed |
| `set` | ENABLED | **NONE** | **HIGH** | **Add policies immediately** |

### Policy Coverage by Table

| Table | Policies | Commands Covered | Assessment |
|-------|----------|------------------|------------|
| `users` | 1 | ALL | Has ALL command policy |
| `workout` | 4 | SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE | Full CRUD coverage |
| `exercise` | 4 | SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE | Full CRUD coverage |
| `set` | **0** | **NONE** | **CRITICAL GAP** |

### Privilege Escalation Test Results

#### Test 1: WHERE TRUE Bypass
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE TRUE;
-- Expected: 1 row (current user only)  
-- Actual: 5 rows (ALL USERS VISIBLE)
-- Result: ❌ FAIL - RLS BYPASS SUCCESSFUL
```

#### Test 2: Cross-User Data Access
```sql
-- User 1 context: Should see 2 workouts
-- Actual: Sees 26 workouts (all users)
-- Result: ❌ FAIL - DATA ISOLATION BROKEN
```

#### Test 3: SQL Injection Pattern  
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = current_user_id() OR 1=1;
-- Expected: 1 row (injection blocked)
-- Actual: 5 rows (injection successful)  
-- Result: ❌ FAIL - INJECTION BYPASS
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues
1. **Missing Policies:** `set` table has RLS enabled but no policies
2. **Policy Logic Error:** Existing policies may not be properly restricting access
3. **Session Context:** `current_user_id()` function may not be working as expected

### Investigation Needed
- Verify `current_user_id()` function is returning correct values
- Check if application is properly setting `app.current_user_id` session variable
- Review policy logic for potential flaws

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. **URGENT: Add Missing Policies for `set` Table**
```sql
-- Add policies for set table
CREATE POLICY set_select_policy ON "set"
    FOR SELECT TO PUBLIC
    USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM workout w 
            WHERE w.id = "set".workout_id 
            AND w.user_id = current_user_id()
        )
    );
-- Add similar policies for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
```

### 2. **URGENT: Debug Existing Policy Logic**
- Investigate why users can see all data instead of just their own
- Verify session variable setting in application code
- Test `current_user_id()` function behavior

### 3. **Verify Policy Effectiveness**
- Re-run privilege escalation tests after fixes
- Conduct additional penetration testing
- Validate data isolation works correctly

## Security Recommendations

### Short Term (Immediate)
1. **Block production deployment** until RLS issues are resolved
2. Add missing RLS policies for `set` table
3. Debug and fix existing policy logic
4. Re-run all security tests

### Medium Term  
1. Implement automated RLS testing in CI/CD
2. Add monitoring for RLS policy violations
3. Regular security audits of database access patterns
4. Consider additional defense-in-depth measures

### Long Term
1. Database access logging and monitoring
2. Regular penetration testing
3. Security code reviews for database access
4. Staff security training on RLS best practices

## Test Artifacts

- **Audit Script:** `scripts/audit-rls-coverage.sql`
- **Privilege Escalation Tests:** `scripts/test-privilege-escalation-fixed.sql`  
- **Test Data Setup:** `scripts/setup-test-data.sql`

## Conclusion

**The current RLS implementation has critical security vulnerabilities that allow complete bypass of data isolation controls.** This represents a severe security risk that could expose all user data to unauthorized access.

**Recommendation: DO NOT DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION** until all identified issues are resolved and verified through comprehensive security testing.

**Next Steps:**
1. Create GitHub issue to track RLS fixes
2. Implement missing policies  
3. Debug existing policy logic
4. Re-run security validation
5. Document remediation in follow-up PR
