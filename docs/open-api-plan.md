If you’ve got a **Go backend** and you want **TypeScript types** that match the shape of your API responses, there are a few solid options depending on how your backend is structured and how formal your API schema is.

---

## **1. If You Already Have an OpenAPI/Swagger Spec**

If your Go backend already uses something like [`swaggo`](https://github.com/swaggo/swag) or [`go-swagger`](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger), you can:

* **Generate OpenAPI JSON/YAML from Go structs**
* Use a TypeScript generator on the OpenAPI spec, e.g.:

  * [`openapi-typescript`](https://github.com/drwpow/openapi-typescript) →

    ```sh
    npx openapi-typescript http://localhost:8080/swagger.json --output api-types.ts
    ```
  * [`swagger-typescript-api`](https://github.com/acacode/swagger-typescript-api) (also generates API clients)
  * [`@orval/core`](https://orval.dev/) (generates types + client)

This gives you **fully typed API responses** directly from your Go annotations.

---

## **2. If You Don’t Have OpenAPI but Have JSON Examples**

You can use tools to infer TypeScript types from sample JSON responses:

* **Quick one-off generation**

  * [quicktype.io](https://quicktype.io/) — paste JSON, get TypeScript interfaces
  * [`quicktype` CLI](https://github.com/quicktype/quicktype):

    ```sh
    npx quicktype --src response.json --lang typescript -o api-types.ts
    ```

* **Automated from live API calls**

  * Write a script that fetches your API in dev, dumps JSON, and feeds it to quicktype

---

## **3. If You Want to Derive Types from Go Structs Directly**

There are Go tools that generate `.ts` types straight from your Go models:

* [`gqlgen`](https://gqlgen.com/) (if using GraphQL — automatically generates TypeScript from schema)
* [`go2ts`](https://github.com/lu4p/go2ts) — reads Go structs → generates TypeScript
* [`tsgen`](https://github.com/clipperhouse/gen) — works with Go code generation tags
* [`go2ts` fork with JSON tags](https://github.com/fforchino/go2ts) for better matching

Example with `go2ts`:

```sh
go install github.com/lu4p/go2ts@latest
go2ts -i models.go -o types.ts
```

---

## **4. If You Want Runtime Type Safety + Types**

You can combine **runtime validation** and **type generation**:

* [Zod](https://zod.dev/) + [`ts-to-zod`](https://github.com/fabien0102/ts-to-zod) (TypeScript → Zod)
* [Zodios](https://zodios.github.io/) or [`zod-openapi`](https://github.com/asteasolutions/zod-to-openapi) (if you want OpenAPI too)
* io-ts, Valibot, etc.

This approach ensures the types aren’t just *declared*, but also *validated*.

---

## **Recommended Setup if You Control the Go Backend**

If you own both the backend and frontend, the cleanest long-term option is:

1. **Annotate Go structs with swagger/OpenAPI comments** (`swaggo` is easiest)
2. **Generate swagger.json** during build/CI
3. **Run openapi-typescript** (or Orval) as part of your frontend build to keep `api-types.ts` up to date

That way:

* No drift between backend & frontend types
* Auto-updates on changes
* Optional: also generate a fully typed API client

---

If you want, I can make you a **Go → Swagger → TypeScript pipeline** example that automatically regenerates types whenever you change your Go structs. That would remove the manual syncing completely.

Do you want me to set that up?
