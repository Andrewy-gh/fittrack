# Audit orchestration log

## Authority and acceptance

- Head: current T3 CHIEF thread. User authorized orchestrating ready fixes on a new branch with verification for every changed behavior.
- Integration branch: `fix/audit-remediation`, based on `633387a`.
- Preserve unrelated `docs/media/how-it-works.gif` and `docs/design/` changes. Never stage them.
- Source of progress: [106-item tracker](audit-remediation-plan.md). Decisions: [review worksheet](audit-review-decisions.md).
- No push, PR, merge to main, deployment, destructive data cleanup or deferred product-policy changes are authorized by this work.
- Workers use T3-managed separate worktrees and the repository's runtime/database isolation instructions.
- A worker report is not acceptance. Head inspects diff and evidence, integrates scoped commits, verifies combined behavior, and requests a fresh read-only Pi / openai-codex/gpt-6.1-sol / high review. Unresolved findings or required verification gaps block completion.
- No nested delegation. Maximum initial implementation concurrency: two.
- Shared tracker and orchestration documents are head-owned; workers must not edit them.

## Wave 1 assignments

| Assignment | Findings | Explicit execution profile | Ownership | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AUDIT-W1-WORKOUT | A001–A004 | Pi / openai-codex/gpt-6.1-sol / medium | Workout editing/null semantics, new-workout default date, local draft catalog persistence, relevant tests and generated contract/SQL files only as required | Running; requested profile confirmed in dispatch receipt |
| AUDIT-W1-EXERCISE | A009–A010 | Pi / openai-codex/gpt-6-luna / medium | Exercise historical-1RM/metrics error mapping and exercise list/create timestamp mapping; relevant tests | Returned; integrated as 7da9a8f; independent review pending and A010 database verification blocked |

The first assignment spans client, storage and server semantics, so Sol medium is appropriate. The second has specified error/timestamp outcomes and a bounded exercise surface, so Luna medium is appropriate.

Workers must report: assignment ID; actual profile; branch/worktree and commit SHA(s); A-ID outcomes; changed paths; checks and observed results; pre-fix reproduction; environment blockers; remaining risks and decisions. No descendants.

## Next actions

1. Receive native completion reports (do not poll running delegates).
2. Reconcile each report, inspect commits and verification evidence. Fix small findings directly; new independent reviews use fresh tasks.
3. Integrate only scoped implementation commits on the integration branch.
4. Run integration checks and a fresh independent review before marking corresponding A-IDs Done.
5. Continue with cache consistency and remaining ready work; incorporate user decisions without guessing deferred behavior.

## Delivery / reconciliation record

### AUDIT-W1-EXERCISE / report 1

- Task: `node:delegated-task:command%3Amcp%3A92085636-86ad-46c8-beb5-365883da1183%3Adelegate-task%3AAUDIT-W1-EXERCISE`.
- Returned profile matched Pi / openai-codex/gpt-6-luna / medium.
- Worker worktree: `C:/Users/lenny/.t3/worktrees/fittrack/t3-07e11d14`; source commit `9c1b58ac3a7e9cefc472d44c4c09f055477515d8`.
- Head inspected diff and integrated as `7da9a8f`. This is provisional integration, not completed acceptance.
- Head reran managed `go test -short ./internal/exercise`, `go build ./...`, and `go vet ./internal/exercise` in the worker checkout; commands completed without errors. Short tests reported success (cached).
- Worker reported a pre-fix failure of both database-error handler regressions; timestamp integration test was not executed.
- Head confirmed database blockers with `doctor --mode test`: missing local URL keys, inaccessible PostgreSQL at 127.0.0.1:55432, wrong Goose version (installed 3.27.0, requires 3.24.3). Docker daemon pipe is absent. Default local worktree profile is absent. Doppler dev and dev_personal key-name checks found neither required local URL key; no secret values printed or generic DATABASE_URL substituted.
- A009 awaits fresh independent review. A010 remains blocked until real persistence and response serialization are verified. No findings marked Done.

### AUDIT-W1-WORKOUT

- Task: `node:delegated-task:command%3Amcp%3A92085636-86ad-46c8-beb5-365883da1183%3Adelegate-task%3AAUDIT-W1-WORKOUT`.
- Requested profile confirmed Pi / openai-codex/gpt-6.1-sol / medium. Still outstanding; do not poll.

### Next review

Fresh read-only Sol high review of `355d722..7da9a8f` will assess A009/A010 correctness and verification adequacy. It must not treat the known unrun database test as passed.
