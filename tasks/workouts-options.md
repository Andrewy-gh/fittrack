I want you to add these components to `workouts/index.tsx` so that we have filtering options. Just install the components and add to the page so I can see what the ui would look like.

1. date range picker: use these commands `bunx --bun shadcn@latest add calendar-04` and `bunx --bun shadcn@latest add calendar-05`. Install both. I'll switch and see what I like best.

**These you can use the shadcn components I have already installed**

2. a drop down to select the focus area
3. pagination - you'll have to install the shadcn component
4. item per page - dropdown
5. descending or ascending - toggle or dropdown - install toggle from shadcn. I'll switch off and see what I like best.

Steps:

1. Just install as is
2. If I deem ui to be clustered, then place the date range picker, focus area dropdown, and acending/descending in a accordion to hide
3. pagination and item per page will not be hidden at all
4. If still too clustered, look into adding shadcn sidebar.

Think about it before you respond. Create a plan for the multiple phases and save it in a markdown file so I can reference it later. Let me know if you have any unresolved questions at the end. Sacrifice grammar for concision.
