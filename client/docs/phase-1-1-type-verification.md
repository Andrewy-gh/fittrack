# Phase 1.1 Type Verification - COMPLETE

## Overview
Verified all generated types from `@/client/types.gen.ts` to ensure they match our schema and implementation requirements.

---

## ‚úÖ Verified Types

### 1. WorkoutWorkoutWithSetsResponse
**Location**: `client/src/client/types.gen.ts:106-120`

```typescript
export type WorkoutWorkoutWithSetsResponse = {
  exercise_id: number;
  exercise_name: string;
  exercise_order?: number;
  reps: number;
  set_id: number;
  set_order?: number;
  set_type: string;
  volume: number;
  weight?: number;
  workout_date: string;
  workout_focus?: string;
  workout_id: number;
  workout_notes?: string;
};
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ Perfect for demo implementation
- This is a flattened/joined structure (workout + sets + exercises)
- Returned as `Array<WorkoutWorkoutWithSetsResponse>` from `GET /workouts/{id}`
- Already used in `transformToWorkoutFormValues()` in `workouts.ts`

### 2. ExerciseExerciseResponse
**Location**: `client/src/client/types.gen.ts:15-21`

```typescript
export type ExerciseExerciseResponse = {
  created_at: string;
  id: number;
  name: string;
  updated_at: string;
  user_id: string;
};
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready to use
- Simple exercise entity with metadata
- Returned as `Array<ExerciseExerciseResponse>` from `GET /exercises`
- Includes `user_id` for scoping

### 3. WorkoutWorkoutResponse
**Location**: `client/src/client/types.gen.ts:96-104`

```typescript
export type WorkoutWorkoutResponse = {
  created_at: string;
  date: string;
  id: number;
  notes?: string;
  updated_at: string;
  user_id: string;
  workout_focus?: string;
};
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ For workout list views
- Basic workout entity without sets
- Returned as `Array<WorkoutWorkoutResponse>` from `GET /workouts`

### 4. Additional Supporting Types

#### ExerciseRecentSetsResponse
**Location**: `client/src/client/types.gen.ts:38-47`

```typescript
export type ExerciseRecentSetsResponse = {
  created_at: string;
  exercise_order?: number;
  reps: number;
  set_id: number;
  set_order?: number;
  weight?: number;
  workout_date: string;
  workout_id: number;
};
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ For exercise detail views
- Shows recent sets for a specific exercise
- Used by `GET /exercises/{id}/recent-sets`

#### Mutation Input Types
**Location**: `client/src/client/types.gen.ts:57-91`

```typescript
export type WorkoutCreateWorkoutRequest = {
  date: string;
  exercises: Array<WorkoutExerciseInput>;
  notes?: string;
  workoutFocus?: string;
};

export type WorkoutExerciseInput = {
  name: string;
  sets: Array<WorkoutSetInput>;
};

export type WorkoutSetInput = {
  reps: number;
  setType: "warmup" | "working";
  weight?: number;
};

export type WorkoutUpdateWorkoutRequest = {
  date: string;
  exercises: Array<WorkoutUpdateExercise>;
  notes?: string;
  workoutFocus?: string;
};
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ For create/update operations
- Used by `POST /workouts` and `PUT /workouts/{id}`
- Already utilized in existing mutations

---

## üîç User Type Analysis

**Finding**: No explicit `User` type exists in generated types.

**Explanation**:
- User information is embedded in entity responses via `user_id: string`
- The backend uses Stack Auth which provides user context automatically
- For demo purposes, we'll use a constant demo user ID: `"demo-user"`

**Demo User Object** (for consistency):
```typescript
const DEMO_USER = {
  id: 1,
  user_id: "demo-user",
  created_at: new Date().toISOString(),
};
```

---

## üìä Data Relationships

### Schema Structure (from database)
```
users
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workouts (via user_id)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exercises (via user_id)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sets (via user_id)

workout ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
          ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí set (junction table)
exercise ‚îÄ‚îò
```

### Key Relationships
1. **Workout ‚Üí Sets**: One-to-many via `set.workout_id`
2. **Exercise ‚Üí Sets**: One-to-many via `set.exercise_id`
3. **Sets as Junction**: Links workouts and exercises with ordering

### Important Fields
- `exercise_order`: Position of exercise within workout (0, 1, 2...)
- `set_order`: Position of set within exercise (0, 1, 2...)
- `set_type`: Either "warmup" or "working"
- `weight`: Optional (bodyweight exercises may omit)
- `reps`: Required for all sets

---

## üéØ Implementation Strategy

### localStorage Schema
We'll store three separate entities in localStorage:

```typescript
// Storage Keys
const STORAGE_KEYS = {
  WORKOUTS: 'fittrack-demo-workouts',
  EXERCISES: 'fittrack-demo-exercises',
  SETS: 'fittrack-demo-sets',
} as const;
```

### Data Structures
```typescript
// localStorage['fittrack-demo-workouts']
type StoredWorkout = WorkoutWorkoutResponse;

// localStorage['fittrack-demo-exercises']
type StoredExercise = ExerciseExerciseResponse;

// localStorage['fittrack-demo-sets']
type StoredSet = {
  id: number;
  exercise_id: number;
  workout_id: number;
  weight?: number;
  reps: number;
  set_type: "warmup" | "working";
  exercise_order: number;
  set_order: number;
  user_id: string;
  created_at: string;
};
```

### Joining Strategy
When constructing `WorkoutWorkoutWithSetsResponse[]`, we'll:
1. Load workout by ID from `fittrack-demo-workouts`
2. Load all sets for that workout from `fittrack-demo-sets` (filter by `workout_id`)
3. Load exercises referenced by those sets from `fittrack-demo-exercises`
4. Flatten/join into the expected response shape

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

- [x] `WorkoutWorkoutWithSetsResponse` structure verified
- [x] `ExerciseExerciseResponse` structure verified
- [x] User type analyzed (no explicit type, will use `user_id: string`)
- [x] Data relationships documented

- [x] Exercise ‚Üí Sets relationship understood (one-to-many via `exercise_id`)
- [x] Set ordering fields identified (`exercise_order`, `set_order`)
- [x] Set type constraints verified ("warmup" | "working")
- [x] localStorage schema designed to match API types
- [x] Joining strategy planned for demo queries

## üöÄ Next Steps (Phase 1.2)

Now that types are verified, we can proceed to create:

1. `client/src/lib/demo-data/types.ts` - Re-export types from `@/client`
2. `client/src/lib/demo-data/initial-data.ts` - Seed data matching these exact types
3. `client/src/lib/demo-data/storage.ts` - localStorage utilities with type safety
4. `client/src/lib/demo-data/query-options.ts` - Demo query/mutation functions

**Critical Requirement**: All mock data MUST match these generated types exactly to ensure compatibility when OpenAPI schema regenerates.

## üìù Key Learnings

1. **Flattened vs Nested Responses**:
   - `GET /workouts` returns `WorkoutWorkoutResponse[]` (basic list)
   - `GET /workouts/{id}` returns `WorkoutWorkoutWithSetsResponse[]` (joined/flattened)
   - This is a denormalized query result, NOT nested objects

2. **No Manual Type Definitions**:
   - All types come from `@/client/types.gen.ts`
   - Never define types manually - import and re-export only
   - This ensures survival through OpenAPI regeneration

3. **Set Type Values**:
   - Limited to `"warmup" | "working"` literal union
   - Backend enforces this constraint
   - Demo data must respect these exact strings

4. **Optional Fields**:
   - `weight` is optional (bodyweight exercises)
   - `workout_focus` is optional
   - `notes` is optional
   - `exercise_order` and `set_order` are optional but strongly recommended for UI ordering
