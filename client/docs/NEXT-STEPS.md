# Next Steps for Demo Routes Implementation

**📅 Last Updated**: 2025-10-05 (Session 7)
**👤 Next Agent**: Start here for quick orientation

---

## ✅ What Was Completed (Session 7)

All view-only demo routes are now live! Here's what we built:

1. **`demo.tsx`** - Layout with demo mode banner
2. **`demo/workouts/index.tsx`** - Workout list view
3. **`demo/workouts/$workoutId/index.tsx`** - Workout detail view
4. **`demo/exercises/index.tsx`** - Exercise list view
5. **`demo/exercises/$exerciseId.tsx`** - Exercise detail view

**TypeScript**: ✅ All type checks pass (`bun run tsc`)

**Files Created**:
- `client/src/routes/demo.tsx` (26 lines)
- `client/src/routes/demo/workouts/index.tsx` (16 lines)
- `client/src/routes/demo/workouts/$workoutId/index.tsx` (31 lines)
- `client/src/routes/demo/exercises/index.tsx` (16 lines)
- `client/src/routes/demo/exercises/$exerciseId.tsx` (32 lines)

**Total**: ~120 lines of route code

## 🎯 What to Do Next

### Option A: Phase 2.3b - Workout Form Route (Complex)

**Implement `demo/workouts/new.tsx`**

**Why it's complex**:
- Deep integration with TanStack Form
- User/mutation dependencies throughout
- Complex state management

**Estimated time**: 1.25 hours

**How to approach**:
1. Read `client/docs/workout-form-extraction-plan.md` (comprehensive analysis)
2. Read `client/docs/workout-form-extraction-plan-v2.md` (refined approach)
3. Use **Hybrid approach (Option C)**:
   - Extract child components to `@/components/workouts/`
   - Extract `WorkoutTracker` with manual props
   - Pass demo mutations/user as props

**Key insight from analysis**:
- Child components (`AddExerciseScreen`, `ExerciseScreen`, `RecentSets`) already use `withForm` HOC correctly
- They're ready to move to shared components
- Parent form needs manual prop injection for user/mutations

---

### Option B: Phase 3 - Integration & Polish

**Skip the form route for now and move to integration**

1. **Landing page integration**:
   - Update "Try for free" button → link to `/demo/workouts`
   - Ensure navigation works

2. **Demo UX enhancements**:
   - Add "Reset Demo" button (calls `resetDemoData()`)
   - Optional: Upgrade demo banner with CTA to sign up

3. **End-to-end testing**:
   - Navigate through all demo routes
   - Verify localStorage persistence
   - Test data integrity (sets linked to workouts/exercises)

4. **Documentation cleanup**:
   - Archive verbose session logs if needed
   - Keep NEXT-STEPS.md as single source of truth

### Workout Form Extraction (if pursuing Option A)

3. **`client/docs/workout-form-extraction-plan.md`** - Comprehensive analysis
   - 900 lines covering 3 extraction options
   - Includes rollback strategies
   - Success criteria checklists

4. **`client/docs/workout-form-extraction-plan-v2.md`** - Refined approach
   - 400 lines focusing on TanStack Form patterns
   - Validates child components are ready
   - Recommends Hybrid approach

## 🔍 Quick Test Checklist

Before proceeding to next phase, verify:

1. **Navigation works**:
   - [ ] `/demo/workouts` loads workout list
   - [ ] Clicking workout → navigates to `/demo/workouts/:id`
   - [ ] `/demo/exercises` loads exercise list
   - [ ] Clicking exercise → navigates to `/demo/exercises/:id`

2. **Data loads from localStorage**:
   - [ ] Open DevTools → Application → Local Storage
   - [ ] See keys: `fittrack-demo-workouts`, `fittrack-demo-exercises`, `fittrack-demo-sets`
   - [ ] Data populated with initial 3 workouts, 5 exercises, 26 sets

3. **No errors**:
   - [ ] Run `bun run tsc` → no TypeScript errors
   - [ ] Open browser console → no runtime errors
   - [ ] Navigate through all routes → no console warnings

4. **Demo banner visible**:
   - [ ] Yellow banner shows "Demo Mode: You're viewing sample data"
   - [ ] Banner appears on all `/demo/*` routes

---

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Choose Option B (Integration) if**:
   - You want to see the feature live end-to-end
   - Workout creation can wait (users can still view workouts)
   - You prefer incremental delivery

2. **Choose Option A (Form Route) if**:
   - You want feature parity with auth routes
   - 1.25 hours is acceptable
   - You're comfortable with TanStack Form complexity

---

## 🚀 Success Metrics

**Phase 2.3a (Completed)**:
- ✅ 5 demo routes created
- ✅ All routes use shared components
- ✅ TypeScript checks pass
- ✅ ~120 lines of code total

**Phase 2.3b (If pursuing)**:
- Goal: 1 workout creation route
- Estimated: 1.25 hours
- Complexity: High (form extraction)

**Phase 3 (If pursuing)**:
- Goal: End-to-end demo experience
- Landing page → Demo routes → Working features
- Estimated: 2-3 hours
