I need to change the UI of the new "Workout Focus" combo box that we just implemented. Take a look at `notes-textarea2.tsx` for an example of how to implement a custom form component. What we need to implement is the dialog. There is also a card that should be showing on new-2.txs. When you press it, it should open up a dialog with the select option and the button to add a workout focus value.
