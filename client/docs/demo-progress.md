# Demo Routes Implementation - Progress Log

## Session Date: 2025-10-05

## What We Accomplished Today

### ✅ Planning & Analysis
1. **Reviewed initial demo plan** - Analyzed the draft implementation strategy
2. **Database schema analysis** - Examined `server/schema.sql` and `server/query.sql` to understand data relationships
3. **Codebase investigation** - Reviewed existing API layer:
   - `client/src/lib/api/workouts.ts` - Query options and mutations
   - `client/src/lib/api/exercises.ts` - Exercise queries and types
4. **Type system verification** - Confirmed usage of:
   - TanStack Query (`@tanstack/react-query`)
   - TanStack Router
   - Generated types from `@/client` (OpenAPI/Swagger codegen)
   - Generated query options from `@/client/@tanstack/react-query.gen`

### ✅ Key Decisions Made

#### Data Architecture
- **Persistence Strategy**: localStorage with full CRUD operations
- **Storage Keys**:
  - `fittrack-demo-workouts`
  - `fittrack-demo-exercises`
  - `fittrack-demo-sets`
- **Reset Capability**: Include "Reset Demo" button to restore initial state
- **Data Limits**: No artificial caps initially (fitness data is lightweight ~100-200 bytes per set)

#### Type Safety
- **Mock data must match generated types** from `@/client`:
  - `WorkoutWorkoutWithSetsResponse`
  - `ExerciseExerciseResponse`
  - User type: `{ id: number, user_id: string, created_at: string }`
- **Query options mirror real API** - Same function signatures as `@/client/@tanstack/react-query.gen`

#### Data Relationships (from schema.sql)
```
users (id, user_id, created_at)
  ↓
workout (id, date, notes, workout_focus, user_id)
  ↓
set (id, exercise_id, workout_id, weight, reps, set_type, exercise_order, set_order, user_id)
  ↓
exercise (id, name, user_id)
```

- **Workout → Sets**: One-to-many via `set.workout_id`
- **Exercise → Sets**: One-to-many via `set.exercise_id`
- **Sets act as junction table** linking workouts and exercises

### ✅ Documentation Created
- **Updated `client/docs/demo-plan.md`** with comprehensive implementation plan:
  - 3 phases (Data Layer, Routes, Integration)
  - ~50 checkboxes for tracking progress
  - Detailed testing checklist
  - File structure overview
  - Data schema reference

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Phase 1 - Data Layer)

**Start here** → Follow the checkboxes in `client/docs/demo-plan.md` starting with Phase 1.

#### Priority Order:
1. **Verify types** - Check generated types in `@/client` match our expectations
2. **Create `client/src/lib/demo-data/types.ts`** - Import and re-export types
3. **Create `client/src/lib/demo-data/initial-data.ts`** - Seed data with realistic fitness examples
4. **Create `client/src/lib/demo-data/storage.ts`** - localStorage utilities
5. **Create `client/src/lib/demo-data/query-options.ts`** - Demo query/mutation options

## Context for Next Agent

### Project Overview
FitTrack is a fitness tracking application with:
- **Backend**: PostgreSQL database with workouts, exercises, and sets
- **Frontend**: React with TanStack Query + TanStack Router
- **Auth**: Stack Auth with user-scoped data
- **Current Routes**: `/_auth/*` for authenticated users

### Goal
Create `/demo/*` routes that allow users to try the app without authentication by:
- Using mock data stored in localStorage
- Maintaining full CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Keeping demo data persistent across sessions
- Providing a "Reset Demo" option

### Technical Requirements
1. **Type Safety**: All mock data must match generated types from `@/client`
2. **No Breaking Changes**: Original `/_auth/*` routes remain untouched
3. **Maintainability**: Mock data lives in `client/src/lib/demo-data/` separate from components
4. **Realistic Data**: Include 5 exercises, 3 workouts, 15-20 sets with progression

### Key Files to Reference
- `client/docs/demo-plan.md` - Full implementation plan with checkboxes
- `server/schema.sql` - Database schema
- `server/query.sql` - SQL queries showing data relationships
- `client/src/lib/api/workouts.ts` - Example query options to mirror
- `client/src/lib/api/exercises.ts` - Example exercise queries

### Routes to Analyze (before copying)
Check what exists in `client/src/routes/_auth/`:
- `workouts/index.tsx` - List view
- `workouts/new.tsx` - Create form
- `workouts/$id.tsx` - Edit view (if exists)
- `exercises/index.tsx` - Exercise list

## Handoff Prompt for Next Session

```
I'm implementing demo routes for a fitness tracking app. We've completed the planning phase and documented everything in `client/docs/demo-plan.md`.

**Current Status**: Ready to start Phase 1 (Data Layer Setup)

**What I need you to do**:
1. Read `client/docs/demo-plan.md` to understand the full plan
2. Start with Phase 1.1: Verify the generated types from `@/client` match our schema
3. Then proceed through Phase 1.2 and 1.3 to build the data layer:
   - Create `types.ts`, `initial-data.ts`, `storage.ts`, and `query-options.ts`
   - Ensure all mock data matches the generated types EXACTLY
   - Implement localStorage persistence with initial seed data

**Important Context**:
- This app uses TanStack Query with generated query options from OpenAPI
- Mock data must survive type regeneration by using the same types as real API
- Data relationships: Workout → Sets ← Exercise (sets are the junction table)
- localStorage strategy with full CRUD + reset capability

**Key constraint**: Do NOT modify any existing `/_auth/*` routes. We're creating parallel `/demo/*` routes.

Please check all completed checkboxes as you finish each task in the plan.

## Notes & Considerations

### Performance
- localStorage limit: 5-10MB per origin
- Fitness data is lightweight (~100-200 bytes per set)
- Even 100 workouts × 20 sets = ~400KB (well under limit)
- No artificial caps needed initially

### User Experience
- Demo persists across page reloads
- "Try for free" button on landing page links to `/demo/workouts`
- Optional: Demo mode indicator/banner
- Optional: Link to sign up for real account

### Type Safety Strategy
- Use generated types from `@/client` directly
- When OpenAPI schema changes and types regenerate, mock data stays compatible
- No manual type definitions that could drift from backend

## Questions Resolved

1. **Should demo have persistence?** → Yes, localStorage with full CRUD
2. **What about user object?** → Use `{ id: 1, user_id: 'demo-user', created_at: '...' }` matching real user type
3. **Performance concerns?** → No caps needed, fitness data is lightweight
4. **Type safety with regeneration?** → Import types from `@/client`, don't define manually
5. **Mutations in demo?** → Yes, update localStorage and invalidate queries

## Timeline
- **Phase 1 (Data Layer)**: 2-3 hours
- **Phase 2 (Routes)**: 2-3 hours
- **Phase 3 (Integration & Testing)**: 2-3 hours
- **Total Estimate**: 6-9 hours
